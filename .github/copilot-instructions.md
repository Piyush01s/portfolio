This is a minimal JavaScript project. Currently contains only `test.js`. AI agents should expand the project based on its intended purpose.

## Architecture
- **Current State**: Single-file project with no established architecture yet
- **Next Steps**: Define project goals, add meaningful code structure, and establish module organization

## Development Workflow
- **Runtime**: Node.js (assumed, no build process yet)
- **Entry Point**: `test.js`

## Key Patterns & Conventions
- None established yet - define conventions as the project grows
- Recommended: Establish naming conventions, module structure, and error handling patterns early

## Testing & Validation
- No test framework configured yet
- Recommend adding tests as functionality develops

## Important Notes
